* What is hammy?
  hammy is an opinionated Erlang wrapper around Christoph Rupp's excellent [[http://hamsterdb.com][HamsterDB]] library.
  hammy doesn't strive to provide a 1:1 binding to all of HamsterDB's API. Instead, hammy's goal is to
  provide a useful and fast key/value store API.

* How do I build it?
  Simply check out the sources and type 'make'. hammy requires Erlang (tested against R13B04, should run
  on R14) and wget to build.

* How fast is hammy?
  Type 'make benchmark' to get an idea how fast hammy is on your machine. In general, you can expect
  hammy to serve about 5000 writes/sec. Of course, a lot depends on disk speed, class of machine,
  and the size of your data.

* Where are the docs?
  It's stll early days for hammy so docs are a little lacking. For now, refer to the hammy module for
  the list of functions available. More docs are coming soon.

* What license does hammy use?
  hammy is licensed under the Apache2 license.
